        "# Evaluating the Danger of Near Earth Orbit Asteroids\n",
        "\n",
        "## Background\n",
        "Asteroids are the rocky remnants of material leftover from the solar system's formation, and are generally found in our solar system's \"main belt\", located between Mars and Jupitter. <sub>1</sub>. The current known asteroid count is 1,302,459, the vast majority of which orbit in the main asteroid belt. <sub>1</sub>. Asteroids are generally classified into 3 categories: Main Belt, Trojan, and Near-Earth <sub>1</sub>.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Description\n",
        "This project will focus on Near-Earth Objects (NEO). These objects are defined as \"potentially hazardous\" when its minimum orbit intersection distance is &lt;0.05 AU (4,647,790 mi) and it has an absolute magnitude of H&lt;22 (i.e. mean diameter > 140 m)<sub>2</sub>. Given that we are evaluating space-bound objects, it is important to remember that many of these values are given in a range format, or are an estimation based on available data sources. The data has been gathered in a kaggle dataset, which was sourced from the NASA NEO Earth Close Approaches API (https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/ca/).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Performance Metrics\n",
        "In this project, we have a set of 27,423 unique NEO objects with accompanying attribute data such as estimated diameter, relative velocity (to Earth at close approach), the distance by which it misses the Earth, its absolute magnitude, and whether or not it is considered \"hazardous\".\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this project will be to clean the data to ensure it obeys the defined rules for an object being considered hazardous, and to then use this data as a training set for a machine-learning model to evaluate the boolean condition of if an NEO is considered hazardous. The exact mathematical expressions that will be used will be discovered as we progress through the course.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Sources\n",
        "This project is using data from a kaggle dataset, found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sameepvani/nasa-nearest-earth-objects)\n",
